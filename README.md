# CS-410: Reverse Software Engineering

## Overview
This project demonstrates my skills in software engineering and design. I reverse-engineered a compiled C++ program to analyze its structure and logic, then rewrote it with improved design, readability, and documentation.

## Files Included
- `Original CS410.cpp`: Decompiled version of the original program.
- `Enhanced CS410.cpp`: Refactored version with improvements.

## Enhancements Made
- Reorganized code using modular functions
- Improved naming conventions and structure
- Added inline comments and error handling
- Removed redundancies and simplified logic

## Skills Demonstrated
- Reverse engineering techniques
- C++ programming
- Refactoring and software design
- Problem decomposition
