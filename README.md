# CS-410: Reverse Software Engineering
# Overview
This project demonstrates my skills in software engineering and design by reverse-engineering a compiled C++ program to analyze its structure and logic. The original program was decompiled, reviewed, and then rewritten with improved design, readability, and documentation.

# Files Included
- Original_CS410.cpp – Decompiled version of the original program.

- Enhanced_CS410.cpp – Refactored version with improvements.

# Enhancements Made
- Reorganized code into modular, reusable functions.

- Improved naming conventions and overall structure.

- Added inline comments and error handling.

- Removed redundancies and simplified logic for better performance.

# Skills Demonstrated
- Reverse engineering techniques.

- C++ programming and modular design.

- Code refactoring and optimization.

- Problem decomposition and debugging.
